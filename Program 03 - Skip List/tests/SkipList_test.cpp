//
// Description: An object-oriented implementation of a SkipList, which is a
// variation of a singly-linked list providing random "express lanes" to
// reduce average lookup times. This implementation includes functions for
// inserting, finding, and removing nodes. The nodes are referenced by a
// key, which can be any comparable type.
